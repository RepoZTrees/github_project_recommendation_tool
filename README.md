# github_project_recommendation_tool

This programme is still under development. However, this what it does so far:
  
  - It takes username (of GitHub) as a command line argument 
  - It'll print user's language of choice (favorite language) based on the repositories of the user  
  - It'll print the list of username and repository name that were committed recently for that particular programming 
    language. For e.g. if user's most of the repos are in Python, then it'll print username/repository names  
    committed recently for Python.
