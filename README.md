# github_project_recommendation_tool

This project is still under development. However, this what this prgogram does so far:

  - It'll go through username's repositories
  - Based on user's commits, it'll give the language of choice (or favorite language)
  - It'll give you all the repos committed recently in your language of choice. For e.g. if most of your commits are in Python,     then it'll look for recent commits in Python.
